## **Introduction:**
Our project is PackTrack, a web application that is intended to enhance the current co-op search tool NUworks 
at Northeastern University. On top of the existing NUworks functionality, PackTrack enables students* to provide 
objective feedback for co-op positions they have worked at. This feedback system, in turn, provides employees at 
said job and other Northeastern students with valuable insights into the reality of working the respective role 
at said company. Companies can then make changes to their positions so that they become more enticing to future 
applicants by generating better reviews/feedback from other students. 

*When I say students providing feedback, I am talking about students who have completed at least one co-op. 

## **What Is the Motivation Behind the Project?:**
When it comes to applying to co-ops, it is difficult to learn more about nuanced topics of a job placement such 
as work culture, team environment, and skills learned on the job just from the generic application description 
that includes standard work hours, average salary, and responsibilities.
