## **Introduction:**
Our project is PackTrack, a web application that is intended to enhance the current co-op search tool NUworks 
at Northeastern University. On top of the existing NUworks functionality, PackTrack enables students* to provide 
objective feedback for co-op positions they have worked at. This feedback system, in turn, provides employees at 
said job and other Northeastern students with valuable insights into the reality of working the respective role 
at said company.
